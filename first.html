			<p>The study assesses the increased trade relations between Nigeria and China with a view to providing information
on its implication on the Nigerian domestic economy through the assessment of the perceptions of local
manufacturers and entrepreneurs and current trade statistics between the two countries. Data were collected from
both primary and secondary sources. Primary data were sourced through the administration of questionnaire on
400 randomly selected respondents. The results showed a trade imbalance in favour of China, however, Nigeria
stands to gain from the China’s model of growth and manufacturing expertise. The study concluded that the
Nigerian government should encourage massive direct investment and the location of production facilities in
Nigeria by the Chinese firms rather than trade relations to correct the imbalance and provide more jobs for
Nigerians.</p>
